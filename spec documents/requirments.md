# Requirment 1
Make an intro page based on the dialog below.

A: I'm playing around a bit with the layout of the website. 

So the top frame is the landing page with its containing information (partner logo etc) also Date, location and time etc). It would be great to have the Yami-Ichi logo animated somehow.  Or if you click on the logo you get directed to the info page (which you see on the bottom frame). 

Still a bit doubting about the design though. But it could be fun to implement a browser frame somehow (if it is not too much work). Furthermore, on the info page we place all the additional info 

•⁠  ⁠Artists

B: Great!! Maybe we can adjust some animations for it

•⁠  ⁠When starting the page, the Yami-icho logo pops up, and every hand point it out
•⁠  ⁠⁠Simutaneously, the infos can pop up as you said
I think it would also be nice to pop in random spce like alert pop-ups
If the optimization of the website is ok, It can also include the artist banners imgs, I guess
